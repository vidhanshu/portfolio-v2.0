## Overview

Hi There!

This is the second instance of my Portfolio website (The 2nd version of my portfolio). This website is assembled successfully by grabbing inspiration from multiple elegant portfolio websites. Some components and animations of this website are built from inspired websites all around the internet like <a href="https://yasio.dev/" alt="yasio.dev">yasio.dev</a> and  <a href="https://sobhanbera.vercel.app" alt="sobhan">sobhanbera</a>.

If you find the project useful just give it a star ⭐️.

## Features

The major features of this portfolio website are:

1. beautiful dark color combination with gradients.
2. Smooth animations and transitions.
3. Responsive for small-sized devices.
4. And many more to be implemented soon.
5. Dedicated blog reading page
